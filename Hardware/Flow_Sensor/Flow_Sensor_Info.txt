Flow Sensor Noter: 

This sensor sits in line with your water line and contains a pinwheel 
sensor to measure how much liquid has moved through it. 
There's an integrated magnetic hall effect sensor that outputs an 
electrical pulse with every revolution. The hall effect sensor is 
sealed from the water pipe and allows the sensor to stay safe and dry.
The sensor comes with three wires: red (5-24VDC power), black (ground) 
and yellow (Hall effect pulse output). By counting the pulses from the 
output of the sensor, you can easily calculate water flow. 
Each pulse is approximately 2.25 milliliters. Note this isn't a 
precision sensor, and the pulse rate does vary a bit depending on the 
flow rate, fluid pressure and sensor orientation. It will need careful 
calibration if better than 10% precision is required. 
However, its great for basic measurement tasks!


The pulse signal is a simple square wave so its quite easy to log and 
convert into liters per minute using the following formula.
Pulse frequency (Hz) / 7.5 = flow rate in L/min.

Water flow sensor consists of a plastic valve body, 
a water rotor, and a hall-effect sensor. 
When water flows through the rotor, rotor rolls. 
Its speed changes with different rate of flow. 
The hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal.
